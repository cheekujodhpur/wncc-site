<p>A survey by Netcraft in 2012 showed that the total number of websites launched in 2012 were 51 million i.e. 140,000 per day. With increasing number of services fuelled by the internet, web development becomes an essential skill for any programmer.</p>

<p>Consider this even if there is no way coding and your field of work or study cross paths. You would eventually need a personal homepage where you advertise yourself for prospective employers and connect with colleagues worldwide. While you may choose to use many of the online interactive services available to build a website, you may often find your inner curious being hard to press down. You would like to know the inner workings of it, or may even be interested in customizing your website beyond the degrees of freedom provided by such services.</p>

<p>
Arriving at the point, learning web development is totally worth it. To facilitate that, WnCC held a workshop on HTML and CSS, conducted by Abhijit Tomar and Chandra Maloo. The New Software Lab (NSL) proved insufficient to hold the large gathering of freshers enthusiastic about trying their hand at building their own website, and the event was extended to NSL Annex.</p>

<p>The end of the workshop announced a week long competition to build an IITB homepage, the best of which will win WnCC goodies and an eternal place on our Hall of Fame.</p>
